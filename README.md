# Add Offline Accounts To PrismLauncher

### NOTE:

This guide shouldn't be given __any__ sort of mass publicity whatsoever, I'm okay if it's shared in small groups but I'm not at all okay with having this shared on mass.

### Description

> Updated to 9.0+

This is a guide to how you can bypass the block of adding an offline account in PrismLauncher, without a Microsoft account.

### Instructions

1) Downnload and install PrismLaunncher by clicking [here](https://prismlauncher.org/download/).
> For Linux it's reccomended you use Flathub or your distro's package manager.

2) Download the `accounts.json` file from [releases](https://github.com/Rustring/PrismLauncher-Cracking-Guide/releases).
  
3) Navigate to the PrismLauncher root diresctory according to your OS:
* Windows: Press Win+R and write "%appdata%\PrismLauncher"
* MacOS: Navigate to "~/Library/Application Support/PrismLauncher"
* Linux (Base Package): Navigate to "~/.local/share/PrismLauncher"
* Linux (Flatpak): Navigate to "~/.var/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/data/PrismLauncher"

4) Copy the file `accounts.json` file you downloaded and paste it there.

5) Now open PrismLauncher and continue the launcher's post setup, and adding an offline account should work.
> You may also launch the launcher before then perform the steps but any way is alright.

__MAKE SURE YOU ADD A NEW ACCOUNT BEFORE LAUNCHING THE GAME AND DO NOT DELETE THE ACCOUNT NAMED XYZ__

Moreover, the account named XYZ shouldn't be used at all, as a usable account, and simply should be kept around with another account being used on its place.
